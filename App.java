/*
 * A famous cinema company has asked us to develop an application for the

3.- Reserve a seat.

4.- Cancel the reservation of a seat.

5.- Cancel all reservations of a person.

0.- Exit.

The application will have the following classes:

Main Class

It will have the main of the application where an object of the Cine class
 will be instantiated and call its start method.


Armchair Class

It will have the details of a seat:

Attributes:

    Row number.

    Number of seats

    Person who reserves the seat.

Methods:

    Constructor with all parameters.

    Getters for all attributes.

    Equal: will return that two seats are equal if the row and seat are the

    Number of seats for each row.

    An object of the GestioButaques class

Methods:

    Constructor: Will receive no parameters. It will create the Gesti√≥Butaques 
    class object. And it will call the requestInitialData method which will 
    initialize the number of rows and seats.

    start: the application will start. It will call the menu method and depending
     on the number returned, it will call the corresponding method.

    menu: will show the main menu options to the user, ask for the number of the 
    chosen option and return it.

    a seat number (call to the insertSeat method), the name of the person making the
     reservation (call to the insertPerson method) and reserves the seat .

    cancelReservation: Asks the user for a row number (call to the enterRow method), 
    a seat number (call to the enterSeat method) and deletes the seat reservation.

    cancelPersonReservation: Asks the user for the person's name (call to the 
    enterPerson method) and deletes the seats reserved by the person entered.

    enterPerson: asks the user for the person's name and returns it if it is correct.

    a chair that is already in the ArrayList (the cercarButaca method will be used), 
    the custom exception OccupiedException exception will be thrown.

    removeChair: will be responsible for removing a chair from the ArrayList of chairs. 
    It will receive the row number and the seat as parameters and remove it from the
